#Add items to this list that should be excluded from the index, intended for creative-only items such as spawn eggs.
#Format for every entry is "<namespace>:<path>". Tags are supported, must be in the format of "#<namespace>:<path>". Namespace may be omitted to use "minecraft" by default. May use asterisk as wildcard parameter via pattern matching, e.g. "minecraft:*_shulker_box" to match all shulker boxes no matter of color. Begin an entry with "!" to make sure it is excluded, useful e.g. when it has already been matched by another pattern.
